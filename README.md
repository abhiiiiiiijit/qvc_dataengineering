1. **Install Dependencies using Poetry**:
   ```sh

2. **Path to the Python solution**

I have used a jupyter notebook to implement(```solution/pyspark_solution.ipynb```). The target table (parquet format) in in the path ```article_transaction/*``` and the articles in the transaction table which are not present in the article table can be found in this path. ```missing_articles/*sql_solution.sql*```
